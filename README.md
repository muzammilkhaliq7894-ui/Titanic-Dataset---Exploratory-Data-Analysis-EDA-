# Titanic-Dataset---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset (Kaggle). The aim is to uncover insights about passengersâ€™ survival patterns through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.

ðŸ“Œ Key Objectives

Perform data cleaning: handle missing values, fix data types

Generate summary statistics & insights (e.g., survival by gender, class)

Build visualizations to identify key trends and correlations

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Seaborn / Matplotlib

ðŸ“Š Covered Topics

Data types & handling missing data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization (bar plots, heatmaps, etc.)

ðŸŽ¯ Bonus

Visualize survival rates using bar plots and a correlation heatmap
